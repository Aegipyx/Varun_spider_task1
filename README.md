## Common Tasks

### CyberSecurity - Google Dork-Based Asset Discovery

Using Google Dorks, enumerate digital artifacts (documents, credentials, login panels, backups, and configurations) exposed on the internet for a given target organisation (perform for atleast 3-4 organisations) using publicly available Google search techniques.

This task is to find sublinks of a given target organisation using google dorking and maybe find a few sites which the user will not be able to find normally by navigating through the main website.

### Devops - Vault Sweeper

A monorepo in Spider has been compromised. Malicious configuration files (.env) were found containing suspicious environment variables. As part of the DevOps team, you are assigned to audit, sanitize, and secure the repository contents.

This task is to create a bash based tool called vault_sweeper to sanitize .env files present in a given directory and its subdirectories by removing all unsafe and invalid lines written in the original .env file.

### Machine Learning - Vehicle Image Classification

You are given a dataset containing a curated set of images of various types of motor vehicles across 7 classes: Auto Rickshaws, Bikes, Cars, Motorcycles, Planes, Ships, and Trains. You have to use a pre-existing model - ResNet18 to classify these images into their respective categories.
